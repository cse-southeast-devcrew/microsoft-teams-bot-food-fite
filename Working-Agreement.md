# Working Agreement

You *must* do these things:

 1. Have fun!
 2. Create a feature branch...
 3. Only one PR approver... lite touch, go Oprah, "You get an approval, you get an approval, everyone gets an approval!"
 4. CI *build* must pass, Tests, what tests?
 5. Oh and if I forgot to mention it... HAVE FUN!
